Step8: How to construct a table:

Start the div with <div class="table table-responsive">
Follow with <table class="table table-striped"></table>

Step9: Table Head class is for the bar representing the years

<thead class="thead-dark"></thead>

Step10:<th> </th> refers to the header cell in a table

Step11: <tr> </tr> defines a cell in a table

<th> defines a header cell
<tr> defines a row in a table
<td> defines a cell in a table

Card:

The card content allows you to display content that is apart from the rest of the content
This defines the card to be a header with bg-primary as background color and text to be white and make it a heading

Step 10: <h3 class="card-header bg-primary text-white">Facts at a glance</h3>

Step 11: <div class="card-body"> Card body contains the elements within the card's body

Step 12: Within the card body, we have a row <dl class="row"> </dl>

Step 13: <dt> stands for definition term, and like a dictionary, this is the term (or phrase)
that is being defined. Subsequently, the <dd> is the definition of the <dt>.
You can make terms and descriptions in <dl> line up side-by-side using class dl-horizontal.

Step 14: div class is card with card body being bg-light
blockquote class is blockquote
For quoting blocks of content from another source within your document

The p class makes it a paragraph
The footer class is blockquote-footer
<cite> allows you to cite some article or quotations"
<p class="mb-0">You better cut the pizza in four because I'm not hungry enough to eat six.</p>
<footer class="blockquote-footer">
  Yoggi Berra,
  <cite title="Source Title">The Wit and Wisdom of Yogi Berra, P. Deve, Diversion Books, 2014</cite>
</footer>
</blockquote>
